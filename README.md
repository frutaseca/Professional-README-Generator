# README Generator

## Desciption
This Project was created using nodejs and the packages needed to get this to work. This is the first project using backend so it was a little challenging not as much as the other front end one towards the end of the front end section of the class. This README Generator could also be used for future projects to help write a README quicker.

## Installation
First step was making the repo and cloning it to our local device. Then we make our .gitignore folder adding node_modules/ and .DS_Store/ in there and making our index.js file. We put npm init -y and npm i inquirer into our comand line to get the packages needed. Then the code is writen inside the index.js file.

## Usage
The main way to use this is by going into the command line in your terminal and typing node index.js and answer the answers to get the desired result of a generated README file.
